# BigSpicy

This repo shows the steps for merging the SPEF, verilog and spice netlist into a circuit protobuf and generating the spice file of the design which can further be used to perform various tests and analysis.
In this repo, I have used the design of Uart Transmitter implemented using SKY130 PDKS. The RTL to GDS2 flow of the given design can be referred from the following github repo.
